There are several other libraries and frameworks for ontology learning and manipulation in Python. 

1. Ontospy: Ontospy is a Python library for exploring and visualizing ontologies. It provides tools for loading and querying ontologies, as well as generating visualizations of ontology classes, individuals, and their relationships.

2. Ontology Design Patterns (ODP): The ODP library provides a set of Python modules for working with ontology design patterns. It includes tools for representing, querying, and reasoning over ontology design patterns, which can be useful in ontology engineering and learning tasks.

3. OOPS!: OOPS! (OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner!) is a Python library for detecting potential pitfalls in ontologies. It can be used to evaluate the quality of ontologies and identify potential issues or violations of best practices.

4. Onto2Vec: Onto2Vec is a Python library that combines ontologies and natural language processing techniques to learn vector representations of ontology classes and relations. These vector representations can be used for various tasks, such as ontology alignment, entity linking, and question answering.

5. Ontology Design Patterns (ODP) Portal: The ODP Portal is a web-based tool that provides access to a repository of ontology design patterns. While not a Python library per se, it offers a RESTful API that can be accessed from Python scripts to retrieve and work with ontology design patterns.

*** Protégé API: Protégé is a popular open-source ontology editor. While not a Python library itself, Protégé provides a Java API that can be accessed from Python using libraries like JPype or py4j, allowing you to programmatically interact with Protégé and manipulate ontologies.
